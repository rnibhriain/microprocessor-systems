1. Saving any registers that are used during the subroutine on the stack, restoring at the end and only safe memory can be used.

2. I save any registers used and the link register at the start of every subroutine and restore them at the end. I also return the result in the correct register.

3. Ensure that any registers used are the same as before the subroutine is called and that the correct result is returned. Also ensure that there are no memory access violations.

4. Repeated addition to implement multiplication is very costly as numbers get larger. There are a lot of operations as the multiplicates.

5. If there was very deep recursion there is the risk of a stack overflow, particularly with storing the link register for evry call.
