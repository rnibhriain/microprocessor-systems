1. We allocate a memory address to the Input-Output devices and instructions related to memory can be accessed by these devices. The memory space is shared with external memory. 

2. RAM is primary memory and Interface registers use secondary memory. 

3. It can be resource hogging and it is difficult to implement on a system that is doing other things.

4. You need more than one core to poll on more than one interface. Or you can poll for specified amounts of time before polling the other using loops.

5. The CPU must poll frequently so nothing is missed which means there is a higher energy usage and wastage of computational power.
